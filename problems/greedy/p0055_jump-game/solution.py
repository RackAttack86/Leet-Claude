LeetCode Problem #55: Jump Game
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Greedy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/

Problem:
--------
You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first
index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

Constraints:
-----------
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

Examples:
---------
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
