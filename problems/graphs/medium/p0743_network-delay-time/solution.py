LeetCode Problem #743: Network Delay Time
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Graphs
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/

Problem:
--------
You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.

Constraints:
-----------
- 1 <= k <= n <= 100
- 1 <= times.length <= 6000
- times[i].length == 3
- 1 <= ui, vi <= n
- ui != vi
- 0 <= wi <= 100
- All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique

Examples:
---------
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2

Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
Output: 1

Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
Output: -1

    Solution to LeetCode Problem #743: Network Delay Time

    Approach: Dijkstra's shortest path
    Time Complexity: O(E log V)
    Space Complexity: O(V + E)

    Key Insights:
    - Find shortest path to all nodes
    - Use Dijkstra with min heap
    - Answer is max of all shortest paths
    - Return -1 if any node unreachable
