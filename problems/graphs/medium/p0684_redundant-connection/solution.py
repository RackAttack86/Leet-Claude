LeetCode Problem #684: Redundant Connection
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Graphs
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/

Problem:
--------
In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

Constraints:
-----------
- n == edges.length
- 3 <= n <= 1000
- edges[i].length == 2
- 1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
- ai != bi
- There are no repeated edges
- The given graph is connected

Examples:
---------
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]

Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]

    Solution to LeetCode Problem #684: Redundant Connection

    Approach: Union Find
    Time Complexity: O(n * α(n))
    Space Complexity: O(n)

    Key Insights:
    - Process edges one by one
    - Use Union Find to track connectivity
    - First edge that connects already-connected nodes is answer
    - Return last such edge found

        Returns:

        Approach:
        1. Use Union Find
        2. Process edges one by one
        3. If an edge connects two already-connected nodes, it's redundant
