# Problem 127: Word Ladder

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Pattern:** Graphs
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)

## Problem Description

A transformation sequence from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
	
- Every `si` for `1 
	
- `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`, or `0` if no such sequence exists.

## Constraints

- `1
- endWord.length == beginWord.length
- wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
- beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- beginWord != endWord
- All the words in `wordList` are unique.

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
