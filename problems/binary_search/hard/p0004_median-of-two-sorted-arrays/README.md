# Problem 4: Median of Two Sorted Arrays

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Pattern:** Binary Search
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

## Problem Description

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

## Constraints

- `nums1.length == m
- nums2.length == n
- 10^6

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

```
