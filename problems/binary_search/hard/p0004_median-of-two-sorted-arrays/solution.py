LeetCode Problem #4: Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Difficulty: Hard
Pattern: Binary Search
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/

Problem:
--------
Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

Constraints:
-----------
- `nums1.length == m
- nums2.length == n
- 10^6

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

```
