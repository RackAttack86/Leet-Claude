# Problem 74: Search a 2D Matrix

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Pattern:** Binary Search
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

## Problem Description

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
	
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in `matrix` or `false` otherwise.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

## Constraints

- `m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[i].length
- 10^4

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true

```

Example 2:
```

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false

```
