LeetCode Problem #69: Sqrt(x)
Difficulty: Easy
Pattern: Binary Search
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/

Problem:
--------
Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.

Constraints:
-----------
- `0

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
