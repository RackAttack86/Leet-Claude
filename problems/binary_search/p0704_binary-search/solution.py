LeetCode Problem #704: Binary Search
Difficulty: Easy
Pattern: Binary Search
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/

Problem:
--------
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target,
write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index.
Otherwise, return -1. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Constraints:
-----------
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4
- All the integers in nums are unique
- nums is sorted in ascending order

Examples:
---------
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
