LeetCode Problem #153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Binary Search
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Problem:
--------
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times.
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of
this array. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Constraints:
-----------
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
- All the integers of nums are unique
- nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times

Examples:
---------
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
