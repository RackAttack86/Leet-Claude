LeetCode Problem #34: Find First and Last Position
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Binary Search
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position/

Problem:
--------
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and
ending position of a given target value. If target is not found in the array, return
[-1, -1]. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Constraints:
-----------
- 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- nums is a non-decreasing array
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9

Examples:
---------
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
