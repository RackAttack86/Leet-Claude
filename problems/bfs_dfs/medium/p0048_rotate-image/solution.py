LeetCode Problem #48: Rotate Image
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Bfs Dfs
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/

Problem:
--------
You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Constraints:
-----------
- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
- 1000

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

```

Example 2:
```

Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]

```
