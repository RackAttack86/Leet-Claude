# Problem 25: Reverse Nodes in k-Group

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Pattern:** Linked Lists
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)

## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return the modified list.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

```

Example 2:
```

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

```
