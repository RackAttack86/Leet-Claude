LeetCode Problem #104: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Difficulty: Easy
Pattern: Trees
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Problem:
--------
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root
node down to the farthest leaf node.

Constraints:
-----------
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4]
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
