LeetCode Problem #102: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Trees
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/

Problem:
--------
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.
(i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Constraints:
-----------
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000]
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []
