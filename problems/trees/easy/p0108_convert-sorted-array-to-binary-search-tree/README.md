**Difficulty:** Easy
**Pattern:** Trees
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

## Constraints

- `1
- 10^4
- nums` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

```

Example 2:
```

Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
