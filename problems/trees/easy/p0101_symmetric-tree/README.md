# Problem 101: Symmetric Tree

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Pattern:** Trees
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- 100

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true

```

Example 2:
```

Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
