# Problem 117: Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Pattern:** Trees
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/)

## Problem Description

Given a binary tree

```

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}

```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 6000]`.
- 100

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: root = []
Output: []

```
