# Problem 114: Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Pattern:** Trees
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the `right` child pointer points to the next node in the list and the `left` child pointer is always `null`.
	
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- 100

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]

```

Example 2:
```

Input: root = []
Output: []

```

Example 3:
```

Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]

```
