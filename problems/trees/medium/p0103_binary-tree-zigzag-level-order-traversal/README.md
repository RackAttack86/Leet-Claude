# Problem 103: Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Pattern:** Trees
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- 100

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]

```

Example 2:
```

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

```

Example 3:
```

Input: root = []
Output: []

```
