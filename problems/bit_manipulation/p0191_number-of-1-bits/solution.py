Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

Problem:
--------
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has
(also known as the Hamming weight).

Constraints:
-----------
- The input must be a binary string of length 32

Examples:
---------
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
