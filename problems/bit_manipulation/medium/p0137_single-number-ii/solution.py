LeetCode Problem #137: Single Number II
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Bit Manipulation
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/

Problem:
--------
Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Constraints:
-----------
- `1
- 2^31
- Each element in `nums` appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

```
