# Problem 9: Palindrome Number

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Pattern:** Bit Manipulation
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

## Constraints

- `-2^31

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

Example 3:
```

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
