LeetCode Problem #9: Palindrome Number
Difficulty: Easy
Pattern: Bit Manipulation
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/

Problem:
--------
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

Constraints:
-----------
- `-2^31

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

Example 3:
```

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```
