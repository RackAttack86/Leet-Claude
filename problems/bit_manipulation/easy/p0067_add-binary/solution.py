LeetCode Problem #67: Add Binary
Difficulty: Easy
Pattern: Bit Manipulation
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/

Problem:
--------
Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

Constraints:
-----------
- `1
- a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"

```

Example 2:
```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
