LeetCode Problem #136: Single Number
Difficulty: Easy
Pattern: Bit Manipulation
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/

Problem:
--------
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one.
Find that single one. You must implement a solution with linear runtime complexity
and use only constant extra space.

Constraints:
-----------
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once

Examples:
---------
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
