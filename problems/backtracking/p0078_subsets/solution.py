LeetCode Problem #78: Subsets
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Backtracking
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/

Problem:
--------
Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

Constraints:
-----------
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10
- -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
- All the numbers of nums are unique

Examples:
---------
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]
