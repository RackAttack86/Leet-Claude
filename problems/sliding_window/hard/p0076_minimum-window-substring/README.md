# Problem 76: Minimum Window Substring

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Pattern:** Sliding Window
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

## Constraints

- `m == s.length
- n == t.length
- s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

```

Example 3:
```

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

```
