Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Dynamic Programming
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/

Problem:
--------
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a
certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of
them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically
contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Given an
integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum
amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Constraints:
-----------
- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 400

Examples:
---------
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
