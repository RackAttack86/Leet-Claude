**Difficulty:** Medium
**Pattern:** Dynamic Programming
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

## Problem Description

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
	
- Delete a character
	
- Replace a character

## Constraints

- `0
- word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')

```

Example 2:
```

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')

```
