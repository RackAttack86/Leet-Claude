LeetCode Problem #221: Maximal Square
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Dynamic Programming
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/

Problem:
--------
Given an `m x n` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the largest square containing only `1`'s and return its area.

Constraints:
-----------
- `m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[i].length
- matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```

Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4

```

Example 2:
```

Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1

```

Example 3:
```

Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0

```
