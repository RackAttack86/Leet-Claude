# Problem 64: Minimum Path Sum

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Pattern:** Dynamic Programming
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)

## Problem Description

Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12

```
