LeetCode Problem #64: Minimum Path Sum
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Dynamic Programming
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/

Problem:
--------
Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Constraints:
-----------
- `m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```

Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12

```
