LeetCode Problem #149: Max Points on a Line
Difficulty: Hard
Pattern: Two Pointers
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line/

Problem:
--------
Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

Constraints:
-----------
- `1
- points[i].length == 2
- 10^4 i, yi
- All the `points` are unique.

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```

Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 3

```

Example 2:
```

Input: points = [[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]]
Output: 4

```
