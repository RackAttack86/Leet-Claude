# Problem 167: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Pattern:** Two Pointers
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

## Problem Description

Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 1 2 1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

## Constraints

- `2
- 1000
- numbers` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- 1000
- The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

```

Example 2:
```

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

```

Example 3:
```

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
