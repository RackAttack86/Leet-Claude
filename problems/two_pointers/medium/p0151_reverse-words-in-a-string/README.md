# Problem 151: Reverse Words in a String

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Pattern:** Two Pointers
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

## Problem Description

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

## Constraints

- `1
- s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is at least one word in `s`.

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

```

Example 2:
```

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

```

Example 3:
```

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

```
