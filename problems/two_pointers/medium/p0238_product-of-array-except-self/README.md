# Problem 238: Product of Array Except Self

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Pattern:** Two Pointers
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

## Constraints

- `2
- 30
- The input is generated such that `answer[i]` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Examples

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

```
