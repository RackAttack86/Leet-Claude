# Problem 128: Longest Consecutive Sequence

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Pattern:** Two Pointers
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

## Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

## Constraints

- `0
- 10^9

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

```

Example 3:
```

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3

```
