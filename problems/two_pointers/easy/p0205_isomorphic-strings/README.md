# Problem 205: Isomorphic Strings

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Pattern:** Two Pointers
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

## Constraints

- `1
- t.length == s.length
- s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.

## Examples

Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

Output: true

Explanation:

The strings `s` and `t` can be made identical by:

- Mapping `'e'` to `'a'`.
	
- Mapping `'g'` to `'d'`.

Example 2:
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

Output: false

Explanation:

The strings `s` and `t` can not be made identical as `'o'` needs to be mapped to both `'a'` and `'r'`.

Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true
