# Problem 392: Is Subsequence

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Pattern:** Two Pointers
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

## Constraints

- `0
- s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Examples

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

```
