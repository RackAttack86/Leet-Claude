LeetCode Problem #392: Is Subsequence
Difficulty: Easy
Pattern: Two Pointers
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/

Problem:
--------
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

Constraints:
-----------
- `0
- s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

```
