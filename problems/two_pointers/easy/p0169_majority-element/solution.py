LeetCode Problem #169: Majority Element
Difficulty: Easy
Pattern: Two Pointers
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

Problem:
--------
Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Constraints:
-----------
- `n == nums.length
- 10^9
- The input is generated such that a majority element will exist in the array.

Examples:
---------
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

```
