# Problem 28: Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Pattern:** Two Pointers
**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)

## Problem Description

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

## Constraints

- `1
- haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Examples

Example 1:
```

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

```

Example 2:
```

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

```
