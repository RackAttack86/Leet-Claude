LeetCode Problem #75: Sort Colors
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Two Pointers
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/

Problem:
--------
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so
that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white,
and blue. We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and
blue, respectively. You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Constraints:
-----------
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 300
- nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2

Examples:
---------
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
