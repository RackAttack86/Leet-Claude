LeetCode Problem #42: Trapping Rain Water
Difficulty: Hard
Pattern: Two Pointers
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/

Problem:
--------
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar
is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Constraints:
-----------
- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5

Examples:
---------
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
