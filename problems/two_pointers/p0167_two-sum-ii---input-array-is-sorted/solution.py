LeetCode Problem #167: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: Two Pointers
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii---input-array-is-sorted/

Problem:
--------
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Return the indices of
the two numbers (index1 and index2) where index1 < index2.

Constraints:
-----------
- 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
- numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order
- -1000 <= target <= 1000
- The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution

Examples:
---------
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
